# push_swap:

One of the algorithm projects I unlocked is called Push_Swap. The idea is simple, You have two stacks called Stack A and Stack B. Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers. You must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. There are only a few moves you’re allowed to used to manipulate the stacks that we’re going to call “Actions”. The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible.
